# Wrangle Open Street Maps Data

This project uses data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean Miami OpenStreetMap data.

The cleaning process involves:
* Parsing and gathering data from popular file formats such as **.osm** and **.csv**;
* Process and clean very large files programmatically using **Python** and **Jupyter Notebooks**;
* Store, query and aggregate data usgind **MongoDB**.

This project was part of my Data Analyst Nanodegree at Udacity.
